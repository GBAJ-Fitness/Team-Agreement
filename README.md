Prep 1

Gerard Johnson, Brian Kimbrow, Anya Fleming, Justin Agim

What are the key strengths of each person on the team? 
Gerard is good with Wireframing and backend, Brian is good with backend and frontend, Anya delivers with the overall design, Justin is good with CSS.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength? 
Gerard: These strengths are useful to help get a good head start and blueprint or outline how the rest of the project will look. It will also be useful for any debugging needed. 
Justin: I can best utilize these strengths by providing clear, concise and neatly placed HTML, adding creative color and font styles to the text and providing an intricate way to have users interact.
Anya: I will utilize my strengths by adding the necessary information that I am most confident within the project.
Brian: I will utilize my skills in wireframe to build a starting format for the project.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Anya: When starting each day off, I believe each group member should discuss their goals for the project at least for 5 minutes. Maybe do a little brainstorming and put all of our ideas together to execute.
Gerard: The best course of action would be to take each concept section by section and confirm that everyone is on the same page before moving forward. We can confirm what section plays to our strengths and go from there.
Brian While we all have our own portion of the project to work on, each of us should make sure we are actively collaborating with each other.
Justin: The best course is to have hands-on, daily checks of where everyone is on their parts, have set deadlines for when certain smaller tasks can be done, to ease our minds from applying too much at once. 


What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Stop all typing in the coding space to address the conflict. Refer back to the github team workflow to get instructions on how to fix any coding. 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We are all overwhelmed, so we will not be racing to take over on anyone else. The best steps we will be taking are reaching out and helping each other.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will work together by explaining each line of code to reassure that everyone understands.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Make a note to ask everyone if help is needed, start our stand-up meetings by asking if there are any issues or challenges our fellow team members may have happening.

Our group will escalate a conflict to our teachers if all troubleshooting has been exhausted.

## User Story

As a user, I want my client to be able to read about the company to get an idea of whether or not the gym will be a fit for them. Having a good experience with the site in terms of being able to contact us will be helpful so that we can assist them with confirming their membership with us.
